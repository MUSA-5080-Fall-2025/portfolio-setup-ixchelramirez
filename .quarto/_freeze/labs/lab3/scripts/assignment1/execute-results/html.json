The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure.

Counties that could be poorly served through these algorithms that rely on income data are areas that have a large range or where there is a smaller sample population which is the case for most of these counties. This could result in the areas being disregarded or grouped with other similar incomes even though there is variance. \n\n\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\nselected_counties <- my_state %>%\n  group_by(reliability) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  ungroup()%>%\n  select(`County Name` = NAME,\n         `Median Income` = MedianHouseholdIncomeE,\n         `MOE percentage` = MOE_PCT,\n         `reliability category` = reliability\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** The three counties that were selected vary in reliability levels. Del Norte and Plumas are counties that are located in Northern California while Los Angeles is the only county that represents Southern California. The code is only based on reliability levels and not where the counties are in relationship to one another. \n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.

According to the state analysis, the majority of the counties (72%) have a high confidence of reliability with margins of error (MOE) below 5%. There are only 5 counties (9%) with low confidence of reliability as defined as having MOE above 10%. These 5 counties are Mono, Alpine, Sierra, Trinity and Plumas and indicate greater uncertainty in income estimates in rural locations. On the tract level all the tracts had low confidence because at least one of the racial demographic groups had a MOE above 10%. \nFrom an equity perspective, these data quality issues pose a serious risk of algorithmic bias. High MOE is frequently present in rural, sparsely populated, or demographically diverse areas, which means these communities are more likely to be flagged as unreliable. This could lead to their exclusion or underrepresentation in automated decision-making. The data for California follows this pattern as Mono, Alpine, Sierra and Trinity are within the top five least populous counties in California. Trinity, which is the 5th least populous county, does not have an incorporated city which could make it hard to collect demographic population as the population is even more dispersed. In contrast, larger urban counties, such as Los Angeles, benefit from lower MOEs and thus are more likely prioritized in algorithmic decisions. This risks reinforcing existing disparities between larger metropolitan regions and rural communities with regards to allocation of resources and services due to the limitations of reliable data.\n\nThe underlying factors that cause these issues stem from the ACS’s sampling design. The ACS relies on sampling, thus counties and tracts with smaller populations generate less precise estimates since fewer households are surveyed which inflates margins of error. Demographic subgroups such as Black and Hispanic residents are particularly affected at the tract level, where margins of error often exceed 15%. As a result, structural features of the survey produce uneven levels of statistical confidence across communities. If left unaddressed, these disparities can directly translate into biased outcomes when using data in automated systems.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, the Department should adopt a tiered oversight approach. In high confidence counties, algorithmic use is appropriate if outputs are reviewed on a regular basis. In moderate confidence areas, algorithmic outputs can be paired with human review to ensure accuracy and fairness. In low confidence areas, decisions should not be automated; instead, an expert can guide decisions, or the data can be supplemented with additional administrative data. Across all confidence levels, the Department should implement equity audits, establish transparent documentation of MOE thresholds, and cross-validate ACS estimates with state and local records. This combination of algorithmic efficiency and structured oversight would enable the Department to take advantage of automation while safeguarding equitable treatment across California communities.\n\n\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using

|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.\n\n1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** \n\nLos Angeles\nSonoma\nAlameda\nMendocino\nNapa\nSutter\nShasta\nSanta Barbara\nVentura\nImperial\nRiverside\nHumboldt\nSiskiyou\nMadera\nMerced\nYuba\nSan Diego\nSan Mateo\nEl Dorado\nButte\nOrange\nMarin\nSanta Clara\nSan Joaquin\nFresno\nMonterey\nContra Costa\nLake\nSan Luis Obispo\nNevada\nSanta Cruz\nTulare\nYolo\nCalaveras\nSolano\nStanislaus\nSan Francisco\nPlacer\nKern\nKings\nSacramento\nSan Bernardino\n\nThe list of counties above have high confidence data which means their margin of error is small relative to the estimate so the reported median income is close to the true value. The median income being close to the true value means that they can be integrated into automated decision-making processes without distorting the results due to high margins of error \n\n\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** \n\nDel Norte\nGlenn\nAmador\nTehama\nMariposa\nTuolumne\nColusa\nSan Benito\nInyo\nLassen\nModoc\n\nMonitoring needed for the above counties, which fall under the category of moderate confidence data might include tracking how algorithmic outputs impact policy or services, testing the upper and lower bounds of MOE for the moderate confidence level and having partial human review to understand what the potential outcomes and impacts could be of using these data. \n\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** \n\nPlumas\nMono\nSierra\nTrinity\nAlpine\n\nThe above counties need alternative approaches due to high margin of error which means the data is unreliable and should not be implemented into automated decisions. Alternatives for these counties include manual review which is when experts who are familiar with the county will handle the counties individually. Additional surveys such as regional surveys could be combined with ACS data to decrease the margin of error.\n\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\nTwo questions that arose were choosing counties that spatially represent an area. When I selected counties two were from Northern California and one was from Southern California, but this was just due to the order the counties were arranged in, how could the code be refined to ensure that counties throughout California are always included? This is an important consideration for California because it is a large state. \n\nAre there any age demographic patterns? When looking at race no patterns were identified due to the high margins of error, is this also the case for age demographics?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 9/21/25 and 9/28/25\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 2025.09.0+387\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: \n\n**Methodology Notes:**\n- If one changes the thresholds for MOE then it will result in different reliability and thus different county selections.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- When looking at the racial demographics everything has data quality issues. \n---",
