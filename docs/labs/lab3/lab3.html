<h3 id="choices-for-data-cleaning">Choices for data cleaning</h3>
<p>Before starting the analysis it is necessary to clean each of the datasets to remove anomalies like houses with no rooms. Although we were looking at residential properties we did not include apartment building as it assigned the sale price of each apartment as the sale price of the building so this was removed. Hence, we are left with homes which mean they will include rooms. We also removed residential locations with sale prices under 10000 or over 1000000 which are very low and high prices and isolated parcel data to data between 2023 and 2024. Census data cleaning involved removing data errors or incomplete fields and adding a column to reflect percentages. The Census data started off with 408 rows and ended with 383 after the cleaning choices. Other data that is also included is university and college locations, crime locations and neighborhood. These are cleaned in a later portion and involve transforming the coordinate reference system so that everything corresponds before filtering and re-categorizing data to help with interpretation</p>

<img data-src="figures/phl_sale_price_distribution.png" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center r-stretch"><p>The graph above shows the highest concentration of parcel sale prices is around” $200,000. The histogram is right-skewed which means most sale prices are concentrated on the left side between zero and $375,000. In such a case the mean is generally greater than the median because the tail on the right could inflate the mean. This affects the model’s prediction for lower income homes.</p>

<p><strong>Justification:</strong> The features included were engineered to capture social, economic, and environmental factors influencing housing prices. Buffer-based and k nearest-neighbor measures quantify local accessibility and safety. Census data helps to enrich parcels with socio-economic context. Interaction terms account for neighborhood-level wealth which helps contextualize external features of a home, for instance homes in a wealthy neighborhood are more likely to have a higher property value than those in other neighborhood. Applying a binary indicator improves model interpretability and performance for the external condition of a property. The table above includes why each feature was chosen.</p>

<h3 id="interpretation-of-plots">Interpretation of plots</h3>
<p>The Residuals vs Fitted plot is around 0 but slightly curved. This means that it could be missing a non-linear term. We tried accounting for this by squaring the age of the home.</p>
<p>The Q-Q Plot shows that the model roughly follows a normal distribution which means using a linear regression makes sense. Ultimately this provides more confidence in our model.</p>
<p>Cooks distance shows many spikes that are the same with a few all ones. A few tall spikes is not concerning as most of them are around the same height but the one on the right side of the graph could indicate a possible outlier that was not accounted for.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<h3 id="detailed-discussion">Detailed Discussion</h3>
<p>The final model explains approximately 59% of the variation in housing prices across Philadelphia, indicating a moderately strong fit. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.34 suggests that the model’s predictions are off by about 34%. The RMSE score means that predictions are abou $154,200 off the true sale price. This level of accuracy is reasonable given the complexity and variability of the housing market. The most influential predictors of housing prices include wealthy neighborhoods, log of livable areas, percentage with a bachelor’s degree, all of which have strong positive effects on property values. Conversely, the percentage of poverty and proximity to crime have strong negative relationships with home prices, underscoring how social perceptions of safety influence property values.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods that are the hardest to predict tend to be those undergoing rapid change or instability, particularly areas experiencing gentrification, high prevalence of vacant and distressed properties or smaller sample areas. Examples of this are Nicetown, Fairhill, and Upper Kensington which are all located in North Philadelphia. In fact the top 10 locations which are the most hard to predict are all in North Philadelphia. Areas experiencing gentrification, rising educational attainment and declining crime rates occur alongside persistent vacancy and poverty, leading to non-linear effects that standard models struggle to account for. The rapid transformation in these neighborhoods contributes to greater residual errors. Thus, the model performs best in <strong>mid-range markets</strong> and is less stable in low-value areas.</p>
<p>From an equity perspective, including socioeconomic indicators such as poverty and education levels improves predictive accuracy but also risks reproducing structural inequalities. By learning from historical patterns of disinvestment, the model may undervalue properties in low-income or historically marginalized neighborhoods. This raises ethical concerns when creating policy based on automated valuation models as it could inadvertently reinforce existing disparities. To mitigate this, residual analysis can be used to test for spatial bias, identifying neighborhoods where the model systematically under- or over-predicts values. Recognizing the limitations within the model highlights opportunities to inform equitable housing policy, such as directing investment initiatives or development funds toward historically undervalued areas rather than further harming them through biased valuation tools. Limitations while creating this model were not cleaning the data in a way that removed abnormalities such as homes that sold for a lot more than those nearby when looking at square footage and not including transportation data which would enrich our understanding of the property’s spatial features.</p>
