## Key Concepts Learned
-Spatial Data Fundamentals: vector model and sf objects, reading and inspecting spatial data, basic spatial data operations
-Spatial Operations: spatial subsetting and filtering, spatial joins and relationships, measuring distances and areas
-Goemetry Operations
-Coordinate Systems: understanding projections and transfporming between coordinate systems

## Coding Techniques
- Buffers, intersections and unions 
- st_touches for finding the board and st_intersects for finding which tracts overlap a metro area 
- Buffers creates zones around a feature
- union: combines multiple features into one
-Changing projection to optimize different properties and have correct results


## Questions & Challenges
- Keeping in mind when to transform so I don't do this when it's not needed and make code longer.


## Connections to Policy
- The connection we are making to policy today is for healthcare to see which areas are properly resourced.

## Reflection
- Understanding how intersections works helps to pinpoint the needed information when looking at things spatially like the boarders of a county vs a tract that is inside a county and should be included.
