## Key Concepts Learned
-Statistical Learning Framework
-Understanding relationships vs Making predictions
-Model Evaluation
-Checking assumptions: 5 assumptions
  Assumption 1 relationship must be linear
  Assumption 2 Independent Variables not collinear
  Assumption 3 Constant Variance - heteroskedasticity
  Assumption 4 Outliers
  Assumption 5 Residuals should be normally distributed 
-Improving predictions 

## Coding Techniques
- RMSE 
- Cross Validation


## Questions & Challenges
- RMSE is a key metric but what is the threhold?

## Connections to Policy
- Cross validation is a good technique to use but more time consuming so generally used on smaller data sets this impacts the type of testing that goes into policy. 
## Reflection
- The Assumptions make sense but I need more practice to understand how they are applied
