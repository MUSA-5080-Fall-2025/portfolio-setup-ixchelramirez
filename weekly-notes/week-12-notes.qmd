date: November 28, 2025

## Key Concepts Learned
- Sequencing matters - neighborhood sequences tell us about patterns of change across metro areas, where different processes occur spatially, racial and ethnic dynamics tied to socioeconomic change, which neighborhoods are stuck vs volatile
- Method
    - Classify neighborhoods at multiple time points
    - Create sequences fro each neighborhood
    - Measure similarity between sequences
    - Cluster similar trajectories 
    - Map the results to see spatial patterns

## Coding Techniques/Technical Side
- 5 Main Steps
    - K-Means Clustering to create socioeconomic typologies
    - Create longitudinal sequences for each neighborhood
    - Measure sequence similarity 
    - Cluster sequences
    - Map sequences membership 

## Connections to Policy & Theory 
- Classic Urban Theories: Chicago School vs Los Angeles School 

## Reflection
- We have learned many new things this semester!
