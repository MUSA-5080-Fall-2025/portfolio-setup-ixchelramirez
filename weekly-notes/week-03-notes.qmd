## Key Concepts Learned
- Hierarchy of spatial groupings in the Census and ACS. 
- Census blocks are in the decennial and the smallest. 
- Census block groups are in ACS data but have high MOE. 
- Census tracts are larger with smaller MOE generally

## Coding Techniques
- ggplot which you use to plot data
- Aes is not for decorating 
- geom is for changing how something looks 
- joins, you can join two columns if they have different names


## Questions & Challenges
- Still working on becoming more proficient in finding the column number that I need.


## Connections to Policy
- Understanding margins of error makes me realize why there must be systems in place to advocate for rural communities as often times these communitites have larger MOE

## Reflection
- Understanding the supplemental data that can be paired with ACS data
